## What Had I learned From Learn-A-Bit Challenge #3

This is the third challenge that I participated for the learn-a-bit challenge series. After I improved my understanding in semantic, mobile first approach and media query, it took me less time to figure things out for this challenge. The main struggle I had hard time positioning the image at the exact position where it overlaps with the card container. However, after trials and errors with flexbox concept, I was able to come with the solution without any references. I was trying to do this challenge without getting much help to strengthen my confidence. Overall, I believe if I continue learning fundamentals of web development through this series, I will become confident about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I look forward to the next challenge.
